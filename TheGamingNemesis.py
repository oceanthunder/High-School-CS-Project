                            NAMASTE!!!üôè
                            
GamingüéÆ is just like living a whole different life than your 'usual'.
Thanks to the ever increasing demand , gaming has become a job for many .. a 'gamer job'.
Now there's so much in gaming to tell about .. so many gaming genres
and such contrasting system requirements that it is hard for newbie gamers to cope up with.
In this project i will use the help of Pythonüêç (csv and matplotlib) and try to help newbie
gamers and PC enthusiasts to give as much information as i can on gaming.
The whole project is divided into four major parts i.e. reading, analysis, visualization and editing.
All these parts are further divided into menus for easy navigation.

{Nemesis means 'an arch enemy'ü¶π .. this project is called nemesis because it was an enemy to my 'gaming time'üëæ}
